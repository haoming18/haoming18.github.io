Hello! Welcome to my website.

I am a master student at the University of Chicago, majoring in Computational and Applied Mathematics. 

I am fortunate to have the chance to work with Prof. [Lek-Heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/) and Prof. [Bryon Aragam](https://www.bryonaragam.com/). I am interested in the statistics and mathematics foundations for morden machine/deep learning.
